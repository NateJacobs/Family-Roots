# Family Roots

This WordPress plugin integrates [The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com) with Wordpress. This is a rewrite of the original [TNG WordPress Plugin](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/tng) created by Mark Barnes. 

### What it does
The plugin requires WordPress and TNG to be set-up a specific way to ensure a seamless and clean experience for all installations. It expects WordPress and TNG to be installed in the same directory. Upon activation, the plugin will search for the TNG file path. On the options page you have the option of manually overriding the path or adding one if the plugin canâ€™t find it automatically. The plugin options page is a submenu located under the WordPress Settings menu.

The plugin is currently at version 0.1. It is the bare-bones skeleton.

### Roadmap
**Version 1.0**

* Unified logins
* Unified user management
* Unified privacy settings
* Auto setting of permalinks
* Automatically create necessary WordPress placeholder page

**Future Plans**
