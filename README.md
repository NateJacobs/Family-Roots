# Family Roots

This WordPress plugin integrates [The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com) with Wordpress. This plugin simply uses the data stored in the TNG database to display the genealogy data.

### What it does today
The plugin expects WordPress and TNG to be set-up a specific way to ensure a seamless and clean experience for all installations: WordPress and TNG should be installed in the same directory (but different subfolders). Upon activation, the plugin will search for the TNG file path. On the options page you have the option of manually overriding the path or adding one if the plugin canâ€™t find it automatically. The plugin options page is a submenu located under the WordPress Settings menu.

The plugin is currently at version 0.1. It is the bare-bones skeleton.

### Roadmap
**Version 1.0**

* WordPress Toolbar access to common features
* Widgetized sidebars
* Add plugin hooks and filters to allow for other developers to extend and add-on
