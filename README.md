# Family Roots

This WordPress plugin integrates [The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com) with Wordpress. This is a rewrite of the original [TNG WordPress Plugin](http://www.4-14.org.uk/wordpress-plugins/tng) created by Mark Barnes. 

### What it does today
The plugin expects WordPress and TNG to be set-up a specific way to ensure a seamless and clean experience for all installations: WordPress and TNG should be installed in the same directory (but different subfolders). Upon activation, the plugin will search for the TNG file path. On the options page you have the option of manually overriding the path or adding one if the plugin canâ€™t find it automatically. The plugin options page is a submenu located under the WordPress Settings menu.

The plugin does not yet display your TNG page within WordPress.

The plugin is currently at version 0.1. It is the bare-bones skeleton.

### Roadmap
**Version 1.0**

* Unified logins
* Unified user management
* Unified privacy settings
* Allow the creation of necessary WordPress placeholder page from the settings page

**Future Plans**

* WordPress Toolbar access to common TNG admin features
* Widgetized sidebars
* Add plugin hooks and filters to allow for other developers to extend and add-on
